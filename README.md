# Digital_Signal_Processing

## Course Overview
Advances in integrated circuit technology have had a major impact on the disciplines to which digital signal processing techniques are being applied. Sophisticated signal processing algorithms are used in a wide range of systems, from highly specialized military systems to consumer electronics for entertainment, communication, space exploration, medicine to name a few. A thorough understanding of digital signals, systems and digital signal processing fundamentals and techniques is essential for engineers and technologists whose work is concerned with signal processing applications. The course covers the concepts of digital signal processing which are fundamental to all the above applications. The course starts with a detailed overview of time and frequency domain analysis of signals. Subsequently, the notion of discrete Fourier transform is introduced, followed by an overview of fast Fourier transform algorithms for its computation. The principal methods for design of FIR and IIR filters are covered, followed by digital filter design and implementation. This course is a prerequisite course for courses, such as communication systems, image processing, audio and video compression, multimedia communication, pattern recognition and so forth.

## Course Outcomes
At the end of the course the student should be able to: 
1. Perform frequency analysis of discrete time signals and apply computationally efficient methods to perform spectral analysis.
2. Design FIR and IIR digital filters for given specifications.
3. Justify the selection of hardware architecture realization.
4. Identify the current issues in the field of DSP by referring to state of the art literature and implement them using proper software/hardware.
